# Contributing

## Getting Started

*   Fork, then clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:your-username/symfony-jsonrpc-http-server.git
    ```

*   Make sure everything goes well:
    ```bash
    make build
    make test
    ```

*   Make your changes (Add/Update tests according to your changes).

*   Make sure tests are still green:
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

*   To check code coverage, launch
    ```bash
    make coverage
    ```

*   Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://github.com/yoanm/symfony-jsonrpc-http-server/compare/).

*   Wait for feedback or merge.

Some stuff that will increase your pull request's acceptance:

*   Write tests.
*   Follow PSR-2 coding style.
*   Write good commit messages.
*   Do not rebase or squash your commits when a review has been made.
