name: 'Test CI updates'
# [DESCRIPTION]
# As CI workflow relies on `workflow_run` trigger for upload, this workflow is used in order to ease updates made on
# CI workflow (or linked workflows/actions). It's kind of pre-check to ensure once updates are merged on main branch,
# the `workflow_run` workflow execution will behave as expected.
